Tidier,59,3,28,0,25,2,1,0,0,"Tidier@0.3.0","e55af54","- Updated auto-vectorization so that operators are vectorized differently from other types of functions. This leads to nicer printing of the generaed DataFrames.jl code. For example, 1 .+ 1 instead of (+).(1,1) - The generated DataFrames.jl code now prints to the screen using `@info` - Updated the ordering of columns when using across so that each column is summarized in consecutive columns (e.g., Rating_mean, Rating_median, Budget_mean, Budget_median) instead of being organized by function (e.g. of prior ordering: Rating_mean, Budget_mean, Rating_median, Budget_median) - Exported `across()` and `desc()` functions which throw an error because they should only be called inside of Tidier macros - Corrected GitHub actions and added tests (contributed by @rdboyes) - Bumped version to 0.3.0","2023-02-11 00:47:05 -0500"
